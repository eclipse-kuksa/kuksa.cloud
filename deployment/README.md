# Kuksa Cloud Deployment
The scripts in this directory and it's subdirectories help to setup a deployment of the Kuksa cloud. These scripts assume a running Kubernetes cluster which can be configured using `kubectl`. More information regarding the parameters of the scripts can be found within the respective script file.

## Structure
The deployment scripts are divided into the following parts:
  1. **Eclipse hawkBit** enables the deployment of the corresponding software update components, in particular the update server.
  **Note that this step requires the installation of the command line tool kompose. Installation instructions can be found at http://kompose.io/**
  2. **Eclipse Hono** enables the deployment of a messaging infrastructure. 
  3. **Kubernetes** provides functions for the Kubernetes deployment of the Kuksa cloud. 
  4. **Utils** scripts that are included by other parts of the deployment infrastructure (e.g. handling static IP-addresses for the services). It is possible to set static IP-addresses and DNS entries for deployed services. For more details on that configuration see the `Readme.md` file in the `utils` directory.
